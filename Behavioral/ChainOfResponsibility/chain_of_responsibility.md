# The Chain of Responsibility design pattern
is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers. Each handler in the chain decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

> <span style="color:green;">This pattern decouples the sender of the request from its receivers, allowing multiple objects to handle the request without the sender needing to know which object will ultimately process it.</span>

## Key Components of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern:
1. Handler: An interface or abstract class that defines the method for handling requests and optionally a method to set the next handler in the chain.

2. Concrete Handlers: Classes that implement the Handler interface. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

3. Client: Initiates the request and sends it to the first handler in the chain.

Example in Python:
Let’s say we have a logging system where different loggers handle messages 
based on their severity level (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, ERROR). 
If a logger cannot handle a message, it passes it to the next logger in the chain.

## Code Explanation:
1. Logger: The abstract base class defines the log method and the set_next method to set the next handler in the chain.

2. Concrete Handlers: InfoLogger, DebugLogger, and ErrorLogger implement the log method. Each handler checks if it can handle the request based on the severity level. If not, it passes the request to the next handler in the chain.

3. Client: The client creates the chain of loggers and sends messages with different severity levels. The messages are processed by the appropriate logger in the chain.

## Advantages of the Chain of Responsibility Pattern:

1. Decoupling: The sender of the request doesn’t need to know which handler will process the request.

2. Flexibility: You can dynamically change the chain or add new handlers without modifying the client code.

3. Single Responsibility Principle: Each handler has a single responsibility, making the code easier to maintain.


## Use Cases:
Logging systems (as shown in the example).

Event handling systems.

Middleware in web frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask).

Input validation pipelines.

This pattern is particularly useful when you want to process a request in multiple steps, and each step can be handled by a different object.
