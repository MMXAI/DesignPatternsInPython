## The Strategy Pattern

> <span style="color:green;">A behavioral design pattern that enables you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it. This pattern is particularly useful when you have multiple ways to perform a task and want to switch between them dynamically at runtime.</span>

### Key Concepts:
1. **Context**: The class that uses a strategy. It maintains a reference to a strategy object and delegates the task to it.
2. **Strategy Interface**: An interface or abstract class that defines the contract for all concrete strategies.
3. **Concrete Strategies**: Implementations of the strategy interface. Each concrete strategy provides a specific algorithm.

### Example in Python

Letâ€™s say you want to implement a payment system where users can choose different payment methods (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal, or Bitcoin). The Strategy Pattern can be used to encapsulate each payment method as a strategy.


### Explanation:
1. **PaymentStrategy**: The abstract base class (interface) that defines the `pay` method.
2. **Concrete Strategies**: `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`, and `BitcoinPayment` implement the `pay` method with their specific behavior.
3. **PaymentContext**: The context class that holds a reference to a strategy and delegates the payment task to it. The strategy can be changed dynamically using the `set_strategy` method.
4. **Client Code**: Demonstrates how the context can switch between different strategies at runtime.

### Benefits of the Strategy Pattern:
- **Flexibility**: You can easily add new strategies without modifying the context or existing strategies.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The context is decoupled from the specific implementation of the algorithms.
- **Testability**: Each strategy can be tested independently.

### When to Use:
- When you have multiple ways to perform a task and want to switch between them dynamically.
- When you want to avoid conditional statements for selecting algorithms.
- When you want to encapsulate algorithm-specific logic in separate classes.

This pattern is widely used in Python and other object-oriented programming languages to promote clean, maintainable, and extensible code.
