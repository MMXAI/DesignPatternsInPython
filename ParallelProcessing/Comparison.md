- Normal Threading is the best.

While all the three methods have the same precision of synchronzation
(as you can run the scripts and test for yourself), the multithreading has the
least overhead in terms of resources and power, and thus is the best.

`Note:` 
In multiprocessing, multiple python interpreters are run in parallel so 
it comes with overhead.
