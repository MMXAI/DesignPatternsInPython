The **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that:

> **"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use."**

In simpler terms, ISP suggests that you should design small, specific interfaces instead of large, general-purpose ones. This ensures that implementing classes only need to be concerned with the methods that are relevant to them.

### ISP in Python

Python doesn't have explicit interfaces like some other languages (e.g., Java), but the concept can still be applied using abstract base classes (ABCs) or protocols. Here's how ISP can be implemented in Python:

---

### Example Without ISP

Let's say we have a large interface `Printer` that includes methods for printing, scanning, and faxing:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Printer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def print(self, document):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def scan(self, document):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def fax(self, document):
        pass

class MultiFunctionPrinter(Printer):
    def print(self, document):
        print(f"Printing: {document}")

    def scan(self, document):
        print(f"Scanning: {document}")

    def fax(self, document):
        print(f"Faxing: {document}")

class SimplePrinter(Printer):
    def print(self, document):
        print(f"Printing: {document}")

    def scan(self, document):
        raise NotImplementedError("Scan not supported")

    def fax(self, document):
        raise NotImplementedError("Fax not supported")
```

Here, `SimplePrinter` is forced to implement `scan` and `fax` methods even though it doesn't support them. This violates ISP.

---

### Example With ISP

To adhere to ISP, we can break the large `Printer` interface into smaller, more specific interfaces:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Printer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def print(self, document):
        pass

class Scanner(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def scan(self, document):
        pass

class Fax(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def fax(self, document):
        pass

class MultiFunctionPrinter(Printer, Scanner, Fax):
    def print(self, document):
        print(f"Printing: {document}")

    def scan(self, document):
        print(f"Scanning: {document}")

    def fax(self, document):
        print(f"Faxing: {document}")

class SimplePrinter(Printer):
    def print(self, document):
        print(f"Printing: {document}")
```

Now:
- `MultiFunctionPrinter` implements all three interfaces (`Printer`, `Scanner`, and `Fax`).
- `SimplePrinter` only implements the `Printer` interface and doesn't need to worry about `scan` or `fax`.

This adheres to ISP because classes only depend on the interfaces they actually use.

### Benefits of ISP
1. **Reduced Coupling**: Classes are not forced to implement methods they don't need.
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller interfaces are easier to understand and maintain.
3. **Better Reusability**: Interfaces can be reused across different classes without unnecessary baggage.

---

### Key Takeaway
The ISP encourages you to design small, focused interfaces that are tailored to the needs of the clients using them. In Python, this can be achieved using abstract base classes or protocols, ensuring that your code is clean, modular, and adheres to SOLID principles.
