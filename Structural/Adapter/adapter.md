## Adapter Pattern
is used to integrate incompatible interfaces, such as when working with legacy systems, third-party libraries, or APIs with differing interfaces. Its benefits include **reusability** (enabling reuse of existing code), **flexibility** (adapting multiple components), and **separation of concerns** (keeping client code decoupled from implementation details).
